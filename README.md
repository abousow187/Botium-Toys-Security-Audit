Internal security audit using NIST CSF
# Internal Security Audit – Botium Toys

## Project Overview
This project is an internal security audit conducted for a fictional small business, Botium Toys, as part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. The objective of the audit was to assess the organization’s current security posture, identify risks, and evaluate compliance with industry standards using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

## Scenario
Botium Toys operates a single physical location while supporting a growing online presence, including international customers in the European Union. The company processes online payments and stores sensitive customer data, increasing its exposure to cybersecurity risks. The IT manager initiated an internal audit to evaluate existing controls and compliance gaps.

## Framework Used
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- SOC 1 / SOC 2 Principles

## Audit Scope
- IT-managed systems and infrastructure
- Customer and employee data
- Online payment processing systems
- Regulatory and compliance readiness

## Key Findings
- No formal access control or least-privilege enforcement
- Lack of encryption for sensitive customer and payment data
- No documented incident response or disaster recovery plans
- Absence of intrusion detection, antivirus, and centralized monitoring
- GDPR and PCI DSS compliance requirements not met

## Risk Assessment Summary
The organization faces elevated risk due to insufficient technical, administrative, and compliance controls. The absence of encryption, access controls, and monitoring significantly increases exposure to data breaches, regulatory fines, and operational downtime.

## Recommendations
- Implement role-based access control and least-privilege policies
- Encrypt sensitive customer and payment data
- Deploy intrusion detection and antivirus solutions
- Establish formal incident response and disaster recovery plans
- Align systems with PCI DSS and GDPR requirements

## Skills Demonstrated
- Security risk assessment
- Internal audit methodology
- NIST CSF application
- Compliance analysis (PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC)
- Security documentation and reporting

## Tools & Concepts
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Controls and compliance analysis
- Risk identification and mitigation
- Security posture evaluation
